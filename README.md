Need to cite licensing for Stable Diffusion.

# How to run (YOU NEED A GPU or EDIT THE CODE so that you use an external API):

- Download and nav to the folder.
- Use miniconda to download and install necessary gpu software components.
- Follow Stable Diffusion 2.1's guide and sample usage here: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1
- Run discord_main.py as a python script ("./python discord_main.py")
- Install any missing stuff that python complains about (I did not create a conda env unfortunately because of GPU compatibility issues between different systems).
